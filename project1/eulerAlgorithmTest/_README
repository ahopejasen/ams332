Matlab does not have a facility to use constants. boo.

Workarounds include using constant properties in a classdef,
and using functions to return the const value.

The former is not compatible with GNU Octave, although it
seems workable. I'm testing both right now.
classtest is the class version
noClass just uses global constants
